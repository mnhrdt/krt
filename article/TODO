CODE

2. normalize parameters for smooth heaviside
3. heaviside parameter should be optional, by default it should be
discontinuous Heaviside


ARTICLE

0. find a better name for "gap"
1. put new experiments with adelson checkerboard
2. maybe try other effects (chubb illusion, cornsweet illusion, ...)
3. run mach bands with noise
4. prepare a complete set of experiments (via a script) for a "technical report"
5. an experiment with color (separable)
6. compare with retinex
7. use the method as a binariaztion criterion (and compare with otsu)
8. [maybe] quantitative expriments comparing it to other normalization
   preprocessing methods for block matching
 9. draw a figure showing the effect of the convolution (2d or 3d)
10. put references as bibtex
11. re-do the histogram uniformization experiments and see if they improve
12. IMPORTANT ISSUE: the "plain" krt (with heaviside H) is by construction
contrast-invariant.  However, adding a "gap" parameter to H, or using a
sigmoid, renders it non-contrast invariant.  This must be discussed in the
article, probably with an example.  This has neural ramifications because the
heaviside is not, so to say, trainable, but the sigmoids are.



DONE

1. add smooth heaviside, and command line option
