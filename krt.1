.SH DESCRIPTION
Krt computes the kernel rank transform of an image
.PP
The kernel rank transform is like the classical rank transform, but
using weighted neighborhoods, defined by a user\-supplied kernel.
The output image has the same size as the input and its values are between
0 and 1.  If the pixels have several components, each component image is
treated independently.
